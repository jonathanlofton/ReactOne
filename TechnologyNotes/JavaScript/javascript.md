# Javascript

**DOM (Document Object Model)** - the dom is whatever is in the window that can be manipulated (elements(div, classes, ids), links, etc.)

- **var, let, const** - declare variables 
    - var: <=ES5 will allow reassignment and is vague
    - let: ES6 will allow reassignment 
    - const: ES6 will not allow reassignment

- **Builtin methods & Standard Data Types** 
    - Objects, Arrays, Strings, Numbers

- **ES6**
    - Arrow functions
    - rest/spread operator
    - default parameters
    - destructuring - extracting values from objects or arrays and assigning them to named variables
- **closures**: A function within a function, how does the function scope behave?
- **callbacks**: A function passed to another function to signal when there is a result ready?
- **promises**: a way to deal with future values ex. (someFunction().then(val => console.log(val)))

- **Functions & Pure functions**
    - pure functions do something without any side effects, so a pure function would take in an input and return an output without any side effects like a console.log that is also within the function. 

- **Functional Programming Basics**
    - avoids shared state and mutable data which will prevent data from becoming corrupted like having two functions simultaneously mutate the same slice of state.

# JavaScript Questions 
**Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript Developers?**
- **Functional Programming**
    - process of building software using pure functions, immutable data, no side effects,
- **Object Oriented-Programming** 
    - process of building classes and utilizing those classes which will have methods and a state assigned to them to build an application. 

- **What are the different scopes available in JavaScript?**
    **In javascript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions that you have access to**
    - Global/Window: will be available to the whole application 
    - local variables: will only be available to the scope that it is currently in

- **ES5 VS ES6**
    - Arrow functions 
    - Classes 
    - Modules:
    - let and const 
    - Promises 
    - Destructing assignment
    - Default parameters:
    - Template literals
    - Multi-line strings 
    - Enhanced Object literals:

- **Fat-Arrow** 
    **positives**
    - Implicit returns if it is a one liner
        - meaning you don't explicitly have to call 'return'
    - Cleans up some of the syntax and makes code more readable compared to regular ES5 functions
    - Doesn't create a new scope
    **negatives**
    - No Binding
        - Cannot reassign 'this' as it 
    - No Constructors
        - Can't create an object with an arrow function
    - No names
        - Have to save the function as a variable to assign a name to it

- **Callback**
    - a function that is passed to another function and intended to be called a later time.
    - a common use case is asynchronous requests

- **Asynchronous**
    - does not wait for work to be completed, it schedules work to be done in the background, usually the browser window.

- **Event-Loop**
    - basically allows asynchronous calls to be run in the background and runs any other code while the asynchronous call is being fullfilled.

- **Prototypal Inheritance**
    - Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
    will return a new object with its __proto__ set to whatever argument is passed to Object.create.

- **DOM Document Object Model**
     - When running code in the browser, the browser provides an API by which JavaScript code can access the HTML content of a page. All major browsers implement it, thought there are quicks across browsers.
     - example of the API: document.getElementById("cats") asks the browser to find an element with the id
        - getElementById
        - getElementByClassName
        - querySelectorAll
    - **Events** 
        - insert and remove elements, change attributes, but this dynamic modicication of the HTML document would be pointless without event handling.
        - addEventListener('click, submit, etc', callback)
        - the event listener will store a function and call that function when the specific event happens
    - **AJAX**: 
    - **EventPropogation** 
        - If you have a div within a div, if you have the outer div have an eventlistener on it and you click on the inner div the listener will propogate up
        -  to stop propogation you can do e.stopPropagation();
    - **Vanilla JavaScript** 
        - writing in JS without any enhancements or libraries like jQuery
        - you might want to use jQuery with rails b/c it automatically will handle CSRF tokens for us, turn JSON(a string) into JavaScript objects.
        - ex of WMLHTTPREQUEST
            - const xhr = new WMLHttpRequest();
            - xhr.open('OPEN', 'api/path/to/resource');
            - xhr.onload = function () {
                console.log(xhr.status)
                console.log(xhr.responseType)
                console.log(xhr.response)
            }

# Questions 
1.) difference between call and apply?
    - using call apply or bind all has to deal with scope.
    - general use function.apply(objectThatYouNeedScopeOf, additionalArguments)
    - call will take in additional arguments separated with commas while apply will take in an array for additional arguments, great for when you don't know how many arguments a function may need to take
    ```javascript

    ```

2.) difference between setTimeout() and setInterval?
    - setTimeout will wait to run a function or some line of code for some set amount of time
    - setInterval will do the same thing but it will then go in a loop and keep calling it every set amount of time
3.) Explain what a closure is and give examples of when to use them and why it makes sense (maybe why it doesn't make sense as well)
    - a closure is when a function will use another function and the outer functions scope
    - a practical use of a closure would be to use an object that would only use a single method
    - a callback that is used for a button press is considered a 
4.) What does it mean that javascript is singlethreaded?
5.) What is prototypal inheritance
6.) How do you make an AJAX call? 
7.) difference between undefined and null
8.) What statement gets a reference to a DOM node by ID?
9.) How do you implement a Map? 
10.) How do you create a multidimensional array?
