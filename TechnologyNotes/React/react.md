# React

**NPM**: Node Package Manager
    - installs javascript dependencies called node modules (libraries)

**Webpack**: 
    - use gitignore to prevent redundent dependencies

**Object-Destructuring**:
    makes it possible to extract parts of an object and assign those parts to different variables. (This is a ES6 construct)
    
    useful when you dont want to have redundant chains

**Babel**
    Translates any of our code whether it is ES6, JSX and the such into ES5. Which will make it more compatible with browsers and node.

**What is React**
    - react is a javascript library created by facebook that will update the data represented by the UI changes.
    - Using react, when data that is represented on the DOM is changed react renders any 'specific' part of the component that is using that data.

**Props and State** 
    - props are immutable, they cannot be changed by a component itself.
    -**State** use statewhenever a component must keep track of mutable, internal data. 

**LifeCycle Methods**
    - componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, componentWillReceiveProps
