# SQL vs NoSQL 

SQL is a relational database that saves data in columns and rows.
  - they allow you to connect tables through primary and foriegn IDS
  - use SQL if you have complex querying, transactions

NoSQL will save data in JSON files
  - use NoSQL when dealing with huge amounts of data
  - there will be no relational pieces to have possibly mix up 
    and cause problems
  - if you need to de-normalize your data in a realtional db then
    it might be worth it to switch to a noSQL language
