# Node Crud Application

**Express:** a framework for building web applications on top of node. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node. In case you were wondering Node allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.

**MongoDB:** A non relational database to persist information. 

**CRUD === CreateReadUpdateDestroy**

**Nodemon:**  an npm package that makes you not have to restart your server everytime you edit your server file

**middleware** things like body-parser and other middleware packages used in express are usually doing something to your request or response before they get handled by the application

**body-parser:** will use a urlencoded method that tells body-parser to extract data from the form element and add them to the body property in the request object.
