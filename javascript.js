Hello Chris!

My name is Jonathan and I'm a Full-stack Software Engineer based out of San Francisco. I pride myself on being a quick learner, look at the three of my most recent projects on my profile, I made all of them in a month and each one is using a different technology. If you have some time check out one my full stack projects 'Drift' (driftmusic.us) which is a single page music app that utilizes the following technologies: React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. 

I have experience in the technologies that Origin utilizes, which is great because I love working with those technologies. I also have an affinity for the Frontend and UI / UX, I can get obsessed with the details of making a website beautiful and intuitive. I'm excited to see what Origin has in store for the future.

If you have some more time please checkout my portfolio page (jonathanlofton.com) and get a better idea of who I'am and what I have created!

Thank you for your time.

- Jonathan

What makes you unique?

I have a background in Environmental Chemistry Research where I was doing extractions and data analysis on Coho Salmon and I was also introduced to programming there. Now I'm a fullstack software engineer in San Francisco building cool projects like driftmusic.us, learn more about me at jonathanlofton.com!
